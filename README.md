## 🚀 Project Overview

Many students struggle with SQL because traditional learning tools often provide cryptic error messages and flat, text-only outputs. **DBstudy** addresses these pain points by offering an interactive environment where users can visualize table relationships and receive contextual hints.

### Key Features

- **Interactive SQL Editor**: Write and execute queries in a real-time environment.


- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual results and table previews to help understand query logic and table relationships.


-**Intelligent Hint System**: Instead of cryptic errors, the system provides guided hints that explain syntax without revealing the full solution.


-**Progress Tracking**: A personal dashboard to monitor completed tasks and learning milestones.


-**Learning Resources**: Includes a study tab with tutorials, ER diagram viewers, and forum discussions.

## 🎨 Design Thinking Process

This project followed a rigorous **Design Thinking** methodology to ensure the solution met real student needs:

### 1. Empathy & Define

We identified two primary user personas: **Aisha** (a 19-year-old student needing visual validation) and **Ahmad** (a 22-year-old focused on career readiness).

**Problem Statement**: "CS students struggle to master core database concepts because existing learning tools provide only flat, text-based output and cryptic errors, leaving them stuck and unmotivated".


### 2. Ideation & Prototyping

We prioritized features using an Impact/Effort matrix, focusing on "Wow" features like visual feedback and improved error messages.

### 3. Usability Testing

The prototype was tested by 8 Computer Science students.

- **Average SUS Score**: **87.19** (Excellent usability range).


- **Task Performance**: Users found progress tracking (5.0/5.0) and layout clarity (4.75/5.0) highly effective.
